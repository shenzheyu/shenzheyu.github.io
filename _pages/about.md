I'm a third year PhD student from [Department of ECE](https://ece.umd.edu/), [University of Maryland](https://umd.edu/). My research interest includes machine learning system, edge AI, and distributed system.

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Ang Li](https://www.ang-li.com/) of CASE Lab from Department of ECE, University of Maryland.

You can find my CV here: [Zheyu's Curriculum Vitae](../files/ZheyuShenCV.pdf).
